# MLP_fromScratch
an implementation of MLP trainbing with Deep Learning from scratch (numpy only, no ai framework)

## descitpion
when running the main it will train a 35.5K parameters MLP with tanh activations to classify hand writen digits for 1000 steps

## results
it will acheve 90% + on the tests in less than 1 minute (on ryzen 7 5700X)
it can reach 95% + on the tests in less more epoches
